    <!-- 1. Rules of Play (Yatzy Basics) -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>1. Rules of Play (Yatzy Basics)</strong></summary>

      <p>If you are new to playing Yatzy, then please read on. If you are already familiar with the game, please skip to section 2 – Quick Start Guide.</p>

      <span class="help-subhead">How to Play</span>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal of the game is to get the highest score by throwing your dice and achieving the best possible combinations with them. If you are familiar with the game of Poker, the categories of this game are similar to the 'hands' in Poker. For example, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house, straights, etc. The game is played by up to two players. Players alternate turns until all required categories are filled.</li>
      </ul>

      <span class="help-subhead">Order of Play</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player starts their turn by rolling five dice. You can choose to hold any of the dice by tapping them, and roll the remaining dice. You will have a total of three rolls. You can choose to score your dice at any time, but you have to score them after the third roll. After scoring your dice, the next player starts their turn. This continues until a score has been entered for each category in the score sheet.</li>
      </ul>

      <span class="help-subhead">Scoring</span>
      <ul>
        <li>The scoring sheet consists of two sections, each with a number of categories that can be scored once per game. You do not need to meet the requirements of a category, but if you don't, you will get zero points for that category.</li>
        <li>Upper Section — Ones through Sixes: score the sum of dice showing that number.</li>
        <li>Upper Bonus: Score +35 bonus points (default) when your upper-section subtotal reaches 63+. Bonus points can be changed to +50 in Settings.</li>
        <li>Lower Section — Combination categories:
          <ul>
            <li>One Pair (Enhanced mode only) — score the sum of the pair (default). Can be changed to 10 points in Settings.</li>
            <li>Two Pair (Enhanced mode only) — Two distinct pairs (default). Can be changed to any two pairs in Settings; score the sum of both pairs (default). Can be changed to 20 points in Settings.</li>
            <li>Three of a Kind — Three equal dice; score the sum of three dice (default). Can be changed to score the sum of all five dice in Settings.</li>
            <li>Four of a Kind — Four equal dice; score the sum of four dice (default). Can be changed to score the sum of all five dice in Settings.</li>
            <li>Full House — Three of a kind + a pair; score the sum of all five dice (default). Can be changed to 25 points in Settings.</li>
            <li>Small Straight — Four in a row: 1-2-3-4-5 (default). Can be changed to any four consecutive dice in Settings; score 15 points (default). Can be changed to 30 points in Settings.</li>
            <li>Large Straight — Five in a row (2-3-4-5-6) (default). Can be changed to any five consecutive dice in Settings. Score 20 points (default). Can be changed to 40 points in Settings.</li>
            <li>Bonus — score ≥ 63 points in the top section, you receive a Bonus of 35 points (default). Can be changed to 50 points in Settings.</li>
            <li>Yatzy — All five dice the same; score 50 points (default). Can be changed to 50 points plus sum of the five dice in Settings.</li>
            <li>Chance — Score the sum of all five dice.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Tip:</b> Before you place a score, the grid shows a preview of the pending scores that can be taken with a black border, so you can quickly compare scores. This is the default setting. If you prefer to see a visual highlight (black border) for those scores that have already been taken during the game, see Settings/Score highlights.</p>

      <p>There is also a Sum category for the upper rows that adds up the scores for the six categories. If you reach at least 63 points in a game, you will receive a Bonus of 35 points (default). This requirement for the bonus can be fulfilled by scoring exactly 3 dice for all six categories. To remind you of how well you're doing, hitting the mark exactly will result in a black number, staying below, results in a red number, and scoring above, results in a green number. This should help you track your progress towards the Bonus points. You can change the Bonus points to 50 in Settings/Bonus score.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>After loading the game for the first time you will be presented with the 'Welcome' screen. Press 'Continue'. Then, on the 'Player Initials' screen, enter your initials or two other characters so that the app can distinguish between you and your opponent. Press 'Continue'. The Home screen is then displayed. The 'Welcome' and 'Player Initials' screens will not be shown again unless you reinstall the app. When you first tap 'Play nearby device' you will see the One-time Network Access screen; tap 'OK' to see the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth permission prompts. Answer 'Allow' for both, so that nearby devices can connect. That screen is only shown once, the first time you tap 'Play nearby device'.</li>
        <li>On the Home screen you have the choice 'Play offline (1 or 2 players on this device)' or 'Play nearby device (Each player has their own device)'. Choose 'Play offline' if you have a single device you want to share with your opponent or if you want to play against the AI. Choose 'Play nearby device' if each player has their own device. Play nearby device games use Bluetooth (default) or Wi-Fi to connect. You can play an opponent at home or while travelling (great for planes and cruises), or any place where there is no internet connection.</li>
        <li>On the 'Play offline' screen, select your opponent. Choose opponent 'Human (P2)' if you want to play another person using a single device or choose opponent 'AI' if you want to play the built-in AI player on your device. Press 'Start game' to begin playing YatzyVibe.</li>
        <li>On the 'Play nearby device' screen, one player should select 'Host as player xx' (where xx is your Player Initials). The other player will see 'Join game with player xx' and will feel a vibration (on iPhone) letting them know they can join the game. Once the 'Join' button is selected, the Host will see the 'Start game with yy' button and will feel a vibration (on iPhone) letting them know they can start the game. The other player will see 'Waiting for xx to start the game...'. The Host then selects 'Start game with yy' to begin playing YatzyVibe. <b>Note:</b> During 'Play nearby device' game play the following Host's settings will override the Joiner's settings: Game Timer, Categories, Auto first dice roll, Two pair/Small straight/Large straight settings, All scoring options.</li>
        <li>Each player has 3 dice rolls per turn.</li>
        <li>Tap a die to hold it (keeps its value) — tap again to release.</li>
        <li>Press the Roll button to roll the dice. The button shows 'Roll' when you have 3 rolls remaining, or 'Roll (n left)' when you have fewer rolls remaining.</li>
        <li>Pick a score box in the grid to lock in your score for the current set of dice. You can tap anywhere on a row to place your score. When you select a score, the entire row is highlighted briefly to provide visual feedback of your selection.</li>
        <li>Made a mistake when selecting your score? Use the Undo button within the Undo countdown timer (default 3 seconds; adjustable in Settings).</li>
        <li>Continue playing, back and forth, until all categories have been scored.</li>
        <li>At game completion, a Winner's screen is displayed showing the players' total scores. The trophy icon on the Winner's screen will automatically wobble for 5 seconds on the winning player's device. For 'Nearby device' games, you can choose to 'Play Again' with the same opponent. Tap the 'Play Again' selector to choose 'Yes' or 'No'. When both players select 'Yes' a new game starts immediately. Select 'Home' to return to the Home screen. Select 'View Score Sheet' to return to the score grid screen. Select the 'View game statistics' button to view the game statistics.</li>
        <li>Exiting an Offline game will return you to the Home screen. Choose 'Continue last game' to resume the current Offline game. Choose 'New offline game' to start a new Offline game. Starting a new Offline game while one is in progress, will require confirmation. The current game will be lost.</li>
        <li>Exiting a 'nearby device' game will require confirmation if the game is still in progress. The current game will be lost. The opponent will be notified that the other person has left the game. If the game has already ended, you can exit without confirmation.</li>
        <li>The Home screen has 3 icons at the bottom:
          <ul>
            <li><b>? icon:</b> Press this icon to display the Help screen.</li>
            <li><b>i icon:</b> Press this icon to display the Information screen. From here you can manage your subscription, share YatzyVibe (Email, Messages, or Copy link), rate YatzyVibe, view Game Statistics, send feedback, open Version History, show the Welcome screen again or open your device Settings to adjust YatzyVibe's Bluetooth and Local Network permissions.</li>
            <li><b>Gear icon:</b> Press this icon to display the Settings screen.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Complete upper rows first to get the Bonus 35 or 50 points based on Settings/Bonus score.</li>
        <li>Lock dice of the same value. If you roll two or three of the same dice, hold them and keep rolling for the best options of scoring in the top rows, one pair, two pair, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house or Yatzy.</li>
        <li>Don't waste straights; a near-straight is often worth holding for the next roll.</li>
        <li>Use Chance wisely. Chance is best for “messy” rolls that don't fit a combo.</li>

      <summary><strong>7. FAQ</strong></summary>

      <ul>
        <li><b>I see a 'Permission Required' screen when trying to play nearby device. What should I do?</b>
          <ul>
            <li>The 'Permission Required' screen appears when you previously selected 'Don't Allow' for Bluetooth or Local Network permissions.</li>
            <li>You need these permissions for your device to connect to your opponent's device.</li>
            <li>To fix this, you have two options:
              <ul>
                <li>Option 1: Use the 'Open device Settings' button on the Permission Required screen. In Settings, find YatzyVibe and make sure both Bluetooth and Local Network are set to ON.</li>
                <li>Option 2: Delete the app and reinstall it. When prompted during reinstallation, select 'Allow' for both Bluetooth and Local Network permissions.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After fixing permissions, return to YatzyVibe and try 'Play nearby device' again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>When I 'Play nearby device', why aren't our devices connecting?</b> Try the following:
          <ul>
        <li>Check that the app is authorized to use Bluetooth and WiFi in both device's iPhone/iPad Settings/Apps/YatzyVibe/Bluetooth/ON and Local Network/On</li>
        <li>Did you and your opponent Host/Join within 60 seconds?</li>
        <li>Is your Wi-Fi/Bluetooth turned ON in the iPhone/iPad Settings on both devices?</li>
        <li>Is your WiFi/Bluetooth selection the same in YatzyVibe Settings/Network Connectivity/Conection on both devices?</li>
        <li>Did you try the Reset Network button in YatzyVibe Settings/Network Connectivity, on both devices?</li>
        <li>If you still cannot connect, reinstall the app.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>After we finish a nearby game, do we have to go back to the Home screen to play again?</b> No. On the Winner's screen, both players can use the 'Play again?' selector. If both players choose 'Yes', a new nearby game starts immediately.</li>
        <li><b>What happens if I leave the app?</b> Your Offline game is autosaved. Use 'Continue last game' on the Home screen to resume. 'Play nearby device' games are not autosaved.</li>
        <li><b>I don't understand what all the settings do.</b> View the Help screen for detailed information about all the Settings.</li>
        <li><b>When will I be asked to rate YatzyVibe?</b> The app may prompt you to rate YatzyVibe after you've played for a while. You can also rate at any time from the Information screen by tapping 'Rate YatzyVibe'. Your feedback helps us improve the app.</li>
