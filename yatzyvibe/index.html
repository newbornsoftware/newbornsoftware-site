    <details>
      <summary><strong>1. Rules of Play (Yatzy Basics)</strong></summary>

      <p>If you are new to playing Yatzy, then please read on. If you are already familiar with the game, please skip to section 2- Quick Start Guide.</p>

      <h3>How to Play</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal of the game is to get the highest score by throwing your dice and achieving the best possible combinations with them. If you are familiar with the game of Poker, the categories of this game are similar to the 'hands' in Poker. For example, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house, straights, etc. The game is played with up to two players. Players alternate turns until all required categories are filled. Player 1 (P1) always begins play.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Order of Play</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player starts their turn by rolling five dice. You can choose to hold any of the dice by tapping them, and roll the remaining dice. You will have a total of three rolls. You can choose to score your dice at any time, but you have to score them after the third roll. After scoring your dice, the next player starts their turn. This continues until a score has been entered for each category in the score sheet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Scoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The scoring sheet consists of two sections, each with a number of categories that can be scored once per game. You do not need to meet the requirements of a category, but if you don't, you will get zero points for that category.</li>
        <li>Upper Section — Ones through Sixes: score the sum of dice showing that number.</li>
        <li>Upper Bonus: Score +35 bonus points (default) when your upper-section subtotal reaches 63+. Bonus points can be changed to +50 in Settings.</li>
        <li>Lower Section — Combination categories:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>One Pair (Enhanced mode only) — score the sum of the pair (default). Can be changed to 10 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Two Pair (Enhanced mode only) — Two distinct pairs (default). Can be changed to any two pairs in Settings; score the sum of both pairs (default). Can be changed to 20 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Three of a Kind — Three equal dice; score the sum of three dice (default). Can be changed to score the sum of all five dice in Settings.</li>
        <li>Four of a Kind — Four equal dice; score the sum of four dice (default). Can be changed to score the sum of all five dice in Settings.</li>
        <li>Full House — Three of a kind + a pair; score the sum of all five dice (default). Can be changed to 25 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Small Straight — Four in a row: 1-2-3-4-5 (default). Can be changed to any four consecutive dice in Settings; score 15 points (default). Can be changed to 30 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Large Straight — Five in a row (2-3-4-5-6) (default). Can be changed to any five consecutive dice in Settings. score 20 points (default). Can be changed to 40 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Bonus — score &gt;= 63 points in the top section, you receive a Bonus of 35 points (default). Can be changed to 50 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Yatzy — All five dice the same; score 50 points (defaults). Can be changed to 50 points plus sum of the five dice in Settigns</li>
        <li>Chance — Score the sum of all five dice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Tip: Before you place a score, the grid shows a preview of the pending scores that can be taken with a black border, so you can quickly compare scores. This is the default setting. If you prefer to see a visual highlight (black border) for those scores that have already been taken during the game, see Settings/Score highlights.</p>

      <p>There is also a Sum category for the upper rows that adds up the scores for the six categories. If you reach at least 63 points in a game, you will receive a Bonus of 35 points (default). This requirement for the bonus can be fulfilled by scoring exactly 3 dice for all six categories. To remind you of how well you're doing, hitting the mark exactly will result in a black number, staying below, results in a red number, and scoring  above, results in a green number. This should help you track your progress towards the Bonus points. You can change the Bobus points to 50 in Settings/Bonus score.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Complete upper rows first to get the Bonus 35 or 50 points based on Settings/Bonus score</li>
        <li>Lock same value dice. If you roll two or three of the same dice, hold them and keep rolling for the best options of scoring in the top rows, one pair, two pair, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house or Yatzy.</li>
        <li>Don’t waste straights. A near-straight is often worth holding for the next roll.</li>
        <li>Use Chance wisely. Chance is best for “messy” rolls that don’t fit a combo.</li>
      </ul>
