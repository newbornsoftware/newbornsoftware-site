    <!-- 1. Rules of Play (Yatzy Basics) -->
    <details>
      <summary><strong>1. Rules of Play (Yatzy Basics)</strong></summary>

      <p>If you are new to playing Yatzy, then please read on. If you are already familiar with the game, please skip to section 2- Quick Start Guide.</p>

      <strong>How to Play</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal of the game is to get the highest score by throwing your dice and achieving the best possible combinations with them. If you are familiar with the game of Poker, the categories of this game are similar to the 'hands' in Poker. For example, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house, straights, etc. The game is played with up to two players. Players alternate turns until all required categories are filled.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Order of Play</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player starts their turn by rolling five dice. You can choose to hold any of the dice by tapping them, and roll the remaining dice. You will have a total of three rolls. You can choose to score your dice at any time, but you have to score them after the third roll. After scoring your dice, the next player starts their turn. This continues until a score has been entered for each category in the score sheet.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Scoring</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The scoring sheet consists of two sections, each with a number of categories that can be scored once per game. You do not need to meet the requirements of a category, but if you don't, you will get zero points for that category.</li>
        <li>Upper Section — Ones through Sixes: score the sum of dice showing that number.</li>
        <li>Upper Bonus: Score +35 bonus points (default) when your upper-section subtotal reaches 63+. Bonus points can be changed to +50 in Settings.</li>
        <li><b>Lower Section — Combination categories:</b></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>One Pair (Enhanced mode only) — score the sum of the pair (default). Can be changed to 10 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Two Pair (Enhanced mode only) — Two distinct pairs (default). Can be changed to any two pairs in Settings; score the sum of both pairs (default). Can be changed to 20 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Three of a Kind — Three equal dice; score the sum of three dice (default). Can be changed to score the sum of all five dice in Settings.</li>
        <li>Four of a Kind — Four equal dice; score the sum of four dice (default). Can be changed to score the sum of all five dice in Settings.</li>
        <li>Full House — Three of a kind + a pair; score the sum of all five dice (default). Can be changed to 25 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Small Straight — Four in a row: 1-2-3-4-5 (default). Can be changed to any four consecutive dice in Settings; score 15 points (default). Can be changed to 30 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Large Straight — Five in a row (2-3-4-5-6) (default). Can be changed to any five consecutive dice in Settings. score 20 points (default). Can be changed to 40 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Bonus — score &gt;= 63 points in the top section, you receive a Bonus of 35 points (default). Can be changed to 50 points in Settings.</li>
        <li>Yatzy — All five dice the same; score 50 points (defaults). Can be changed to 50 points plus sum of the five dice in Settings</li>
        <li>Chance — Score the sum of all five dice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Tip: Before you place a score, the grid shows a preview of the pending scores that can be taken with a black border, so you can quickly compare scores. This is the default setting. If you prefer to see a visual highlight (black border) for those scores that have already been taken during the game, see Settings/Score highlights.</p>

      <p>There is also a Sum category for the upper rows that adds up the scores for the six categories. If you reach at least 63 points in a game, you will receive a Bonus of 35 points (default). This requirement for the bonus can be fulfilled by scoring exactly 3 dice for all six categories. To remind you of how well you're doing, hitting the mark exactly will result in a black number, staying below, results in a red number, and scoring  above, results in a green number. This should help you track your progress towards the Bonus points. You can change the Bonus points to 50 in Settings/Bonus score.</p>

        <li>On the Home screen you have the choice 'Play offline' or 'Play nearby opponent'. Choose 'Play offline' if you have a single device you want to share with your opponent, or if you want to play against the AI. Choose 'Play nearby opponent' if each player has their own device.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>On the 'Play offline' screen, select your opponent. Choose opponent 'Human (P2)' if you want to play another person using a single device, or choose opponent 'AI' if you want to play the built-in AI player on your device. Press 'Start game' to begin playing YatzyVibe.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Made a mistake when selecting your score? Use the Undo button within the Undo countdown timer (default 2 seconds; adjustable in Settings).</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Continue playing, back and forth, until all categories have been scored.</li>
        <li>At game completion, a Winner's screen is display showing the players total scores. Select 'Home' to return to the Home screen.

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Exiting an Offline game will return you to the Home screen. Choose 'Continue last game' to resume the current Offline game. Choose 'New offline game' to start a new Offline game. Starting a new Offline game while one is in progress, will require confirmation. The current game will be lost.</li>
        <li>Exiting a 'nearby opponent' game will require confirmation. The current game will be lost. The opponent will be notified that the other person has left the game.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Complete upper rows first to get the Bonus 35 or 50 points based on Settings/Bonus score</li>
        <li>Lock same value dice. If you roll two or three of the same dice, hold them and keep rolling for the best options of scoring in the top rows, one pair, two pair, three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house or Yatzy.</li>
        <li>Don’t waste straights. A near-straight is often worth holding for the next roll.</li>
        <li>Use Chance wisely. Chance is best for “messy” rolls that don’t fit a combo.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><b>Game Options:</b> Tap a blue button to see the available options.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Dice position: Select 'Horizontal' (default) to position the dice along the bottom of the screen. Dice will be smaller and the score grid will be more compressed. Select 'Vertical'  to position the dice along the right hand side of the screen. Dice will be larger and the score grid will be less compressed.</li>
        <li>Game Timer: Select '30, 60 or 90 seconds' for each player's turn, which adds some excitement to the game play. Note: If a score is not taken within the time limit, the app will score the lowest score available for the dice displayed, and then automatically pass the turn to the next player. Select 'Off' (default) for a more relaxed game play.</li>
        <li>Categories: Select 'Classic (13)' (default) for 13 categories. Select 'Enhanced (15)' for 15 categories (includes One Pair and Two Pair).</li>
        <li>Show best move: 'On' or 'Off' (default). If 'On', the dice the app is recommending you hold will have a green line under the dice, and after the 3rd dice roll or after holding all the dice, the best score to take will be highlighted with a green border.</li>
        <li>Auto first dice roll: 'On' (default) or 'Off'. If 'On', the dice are automatically rolled for you, on your first roll. If 'Off', dice will be blank to allow a manual first roll. Subsequent rolls (two and three) are done manually.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>AI skill level: 'Beginner', 'Normal' (default) or 'Expert'. Higher levels are more selective about which categories to take and what dice to hold.</li>
        <li>AI thinking time: 0.5 second (default) controls how long the AI holds its dice and how fast it rolls the dice. Lower values make the AI game play faster. Higher values give you time to see what decisions the AI is making.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Dice face: 'Pips' (default) or 'Numbers'. Switch between dotted or numeric dice.</li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Two Pair: '1-1-2-2' (default) means two distinct pairs are required to score. '1-1-1-1' means any two pairs are required to score.</li>
        <li>Small Straight: 'Any 4 dice sequence' (default) means you can score by getting any 4 dice in a sequence (1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, 3-4-5-6). '1-2-3-4-5' means you must get this exact sequence to score.</li>
